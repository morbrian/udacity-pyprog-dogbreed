Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three models were able to correctly classify Dog_01.jpg as the same breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes each of the three models successfully classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same correct breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
All three model architecures correctly classified Pig_01.jpg correctly as a pig.
However all three model architectures failed to correctly classify Anvil_01.jpg, and each of the models came up with a different non-animal classification.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
In the context of the uploaded image classification, all three models performed statistically equally making the choice among them somewhat subjective.
The VGG model classified the Anvil as a Cannon, which was incorrect but by my assessment was closer to the visual effect of the Anvil than the Resnet guess of "rifle" and the Alexnet guess of "padlock".
So for subjective reasons I award VGG as being the best in the context of the tests done with the uploaded images.
