## In this project we had 2 main objectives:
1. Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs
2. Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs

* For objective 1, all three could identify dogs 100% of the time.
Both VGG and AlexNet were able to distinguish dogs from other things 100% of the time,
while ResNet only scored 90% for this criteria.

* For Object 2, VGG again outperformed with a 93.3% correct classification,
followed closely by Resnet at 90% and AlexNet much further behind at 80%.


## Results Table

Number Total Images: 40
Number Dog Images: 30
Number Not-dog Images: 10

CNN Model Arch | Pct Not-a-Dog | Pct Dogs Correct | Pct Breeds
               | Correct       | Correct          | Correct
ResNet         | 90%           | 100%             | 90%
AlexNet        | 100%          | 100%             | 80%
VGG            | 100%          | 100%             | 93.3%

By the numbers, it is clear that VGG outperformed the other two classifiers.
While all three are effective at identifying the general category of "dog",
only VGG amd AlexNet were highly reliable at excluding non-dogs correctly from that category.
None of the classifiers were perfect at further distinguishing dog breeds,
but VGG shows a clear advantage with 93% accuracy, and this number combined with its 
accuracy score in differentiating dogs from other items VGG shows the best results  over all.
